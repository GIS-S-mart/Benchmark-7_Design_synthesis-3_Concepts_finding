- # Benchmark exercise: Flashlight

  This document defines the coupling bolt benchmark exercise. 

  ## Introduction

  The aim of this coupling bolt benchmark exercise is to evaluate contributions claiming to to improve the concept finding activity of a model-based design synthesis for system sizing.

  ## System-Of-Interest

  The system-of-interest, a flashlight system, is known in advance as the scope of the benchmark is model-based design synthesis for system sizing. The function of a coupling bolt system is to hold two halves of a flanged shaft together to properly transfer the torque while maintaining shaft alignment.

  ## Coupling Bolt System Requirements

  The concepts must satisfy the following system requirements:

  - SR1. The weight of the coupling bolt system must be minimized.
  - SR2. The cost of the coupling bolt system must be minimized.
  - SR3. The coupling bolt system shall transfer a torque greater than or equal to 400 000 N.mm.

  ## Coupling Bolt System Design Constraints

  The concepts must satisfy the following design constraints:

  - C1. The coupling bolt system must be purely mechanical.
