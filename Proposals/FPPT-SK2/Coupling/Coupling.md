## Design philosophy

The main approach is therefore presented in three main steps:
- A Function-Behaviour-Structure modelling for mapping function to structure via physical principles. That phase initiates the design process and provides the first product information (functional surfaces, physical principles and structural data).
- A multiple points of view modelling for knowledge-intensive design. That model allows the integration of expert knowledge and supports the relation among this information.
- A decision-making process.

## Design method

Models concepts (figure 5) are issued from IDEFØ and bond-graphs theory and goals at:
- Function specification via the conduction or the isolation of energetic flows representation.
- Structural representation as system, sub-system or part. That intrinsically gives the product breakdown.
- Functional surface representation. Those surfaces support energetic flow conduction and are then justified by the least commitment.

That first design phase of the proposed design approach provides what the author calls minimal “usage” information that is then used as input for embodiment design. That information concerns:

- Functional, physical and technological parameters and associated relations with respect to the technology selection process. Those parameters give a formal relation among the functional, physical principles and structural domains that can be very beneficial in case of redesign (ex: to know the impact of a functional change on the structural solution and vice versa).
- Functional required surfaces. Those surfaces do not represent a complete product geometry. The product has not, at this stage, a sufficient definition to be manufactured.
