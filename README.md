# Benchmark 6. Concept Finding in a Model-Based Design Synthesis Process for System Sizing

## Introduction

- **Disciplines**: This scientific benchmark repository concerns mainly the engineering design, systems engineering, and product lifecycle management communities.
- **Goal**: This scientific benchmark aims at collecting and comparing competing or complementary contributions claiming to improve the activity of concept finding in a design synthesis process for system sizing. In this benchmark, design synthesis is a computer-based automatic problem-solving process to generate preliminary design solutions that are correct by construction. A design synthesis process has an objective: system configuration, system sizing, resource allocation, and/or architecture generation.  This benchmark focuses on design synthesis for system sizing. In addition, in a computational design synthesis process for system sizing, this benchmark concentrates on the activity of concept finding.  Starting with a set of validated requirements, concept finding is an activity that intends to find preliminary design variables, parameters and constants, that serve to define the set of acceptable and feasible conceptual design solutions.
- **Type of claimed contributions to benchmark:** This scientific benchmark aims at benchmarking the modelling language?

## Glossary

An agreed-upon glossary of terms used in this benchmark is proposed below. Contributors should reuse existing terms and definitions from existing standards and not invent new ones, unless they have a very specific concept that requires the introduction of a new keyword and definition. Any new keyword and definition must be motivated and explained in the discussion of the repository (e.g. navigate to '*Repositories > Benchmark-0_Template > Discussions*', or [click here](https://github.com/GIS-S-mart/Benchmark-0_Template/discussions)).

## Body of knowledge



## Research Objectives

The fundamental research objective is to find system concepts based on a set of requirements as input data. To improve the results of the concept finding activity, one can propose a new design method, modelling method, modelling language or modelling software. 

## Metrics

Metrics are quantitative and/or qualitative performance indicator that measures the degree to which the articulated goals have been achieved.

*Guidelines:*

1. The achievement of a given goal may be measured by one or more metrics.
2. Results must be quantitatively and not only qualitatively compared to the literature in a fair and transparent manner.
3. Authors should use existing metrics and not invent new ones, unless they measure additional aspects not covered by existing ones.
4. Any change to existing metrics must be motivated and explained in the discussion of the repository (e.g. navigate to '*Repositories > Benchmark-0_Template > Discussions*', or [click here](https://github.com/GIS-S-mart/Benchmark-0_Template/discussions). Once the suggested change is informally approved by the community, the author shall post on the issues page of the benchmark (e.g. navigate to '*Repositories > Benchmark-0_Template > Issues*', or [click here](https://github.com/GIS-S-mart/Benchmark-0_Template/issues)) and briefly outline the new metric.

## Claimed contributions

A solution is a candidate theory, process, method, practice, [...], or software that aims to solve a benchmark exercise.

*Guidelines:*

1. It is imperative for good scientific practice that all results are reproducible.
2. It is strongly recommended to publish the research material (e.g., software code - at least an executable file -, model, simulation, coding book, interviews,  statistics, raw data, observation voice/video recordings, etc.).
3. The quantitative and/or qualitative metric serve as a a level of evidence which can be of four types:
   1. **Measured**: the benefit is measured through a measurement protocol.
   2. **Observed**: the benefit is noticed by the researcher(s) but is not measured through a measurement protocol.
   3. **Perceived**: the benefit - claimed without evidence - is expected or perceived to be evident by the researcher(s) but the claim is not based on a measurement protocol.
   4. **Reference** to another source: the benefit is cited from another source.

## Measurement protocols

A measurement protocol is a logical and repeatable procedure to evaluate the metrics when one use a candidate solution to solve a benchmark exercise. It ensures the successful replication of results by others. The recipe highly depends on the preferred research approach (quantitative empirical studies, qualitative empirical studies, mixed-methods studies, analytical studies, experiments, quasi-experiments, ethnographic research, phenomenological research, grounded theory, hermeneutics, case study research, action research, etc.). A measurement protocol may be solution agnostic or part of a candidate solution.

## Benchmarking

Benchmarking shall enable visitors to determine which solution is better to employ in a specific context.

*Guidelines:*

1. When presenting a new solution, results must be quantitatively and not only qualitatively compared to the literature.
2. The comparison of solutions must be done in a fair and transparent manner.
3. Results should also be critically judged for physical sanity to avoid the ones that make little sense.

## Meta-Analysis

A meta-analysis is the analysis of all results of the benchmark for the purpose of integrating the findings. Meta-analytic results are the most trustworthy source of evidence.
